### One-liner that highlights the company:  
Navitas is a leader in GaN and SiC power semiconductors, offering integrated, energy-efficient solutions for mobile, data center, EV, and industrial applications.

---

### Company Introduction  
Navitas is the first company to integrate all drive and protection components with GaN transistors in a single chip, delivering form-factor improvements and energy savings over silicon and discrete GaN solutions. With a robust IP portfolio of over 180 issued and pending GaN patents (300+ company-wide), Navitas has established a leading market position. The company's acquisition of GeneSiC Semiconductor in 2022 expanded its offerings to include SiC MOSFETs and diodes, further solidifying its technology leadership. Navitas serves top-tier customers, including all top-10 mobile OEMs, and is driving GaN adoption in AI data centers, EVs, and renewable energy systems.
